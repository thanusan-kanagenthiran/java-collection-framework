# Java Collections Framework – Interview Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to the Java Collections Framework (JCF), including detailed notes, performance tips, and best practices for interviews and real-world development.

## 📚 Contents

  - [collection_framework.md](collection_framework.md): Complete guide to the Java Collection Framework, including hierarchy, interface methods, and best practices.
  - [list_implementations.md](list_implementations.md): Details and performance of List implementations.
  - [set_implementations.md](set_implementations.md): Details and performance of Set implementations.
  - [queue_implementations.md](queue_implementations.md): Details and performance of Queue implementations.
  - [map_implementations.md](map_implementations.md): Details and performance of Map implementations.
  - [listiterator_interface.md](listiterator_interface.md): Notes on the ListIterator interface.

- **java_collection_methods/**
  - Java code examples for List, Set, Map, Queue, and Iterator usage.

## 📝 Highlights

- **Collection Hierarchy**: Visual diagrams and explanations of List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces and their implementations.
- **Interface Methods**: Easy-to-learn lists of all standard methods for each interface.
- **Legacy vs Modern**: Clear guidance on which classes to use and which to avoid in modern Java.
- **Performance Tips**: Tables and code snippets for choosing the right collection and avoiding common pitfalls.
- **Best Practices**: Advice for thread safety, memory, and efficient iteration.
